## Info

KECS is a Cross Platform Entity Component System design to create concurrent application, such games,
more simple and without the need of using multiple threads neither fibers nor corutines.

It allows separating data from behavior and get rid of deep object oriented inheritance.

Due to data-oriented design allow modern processors to highly optimize it for an over perform of more traditional
systems.

If you like to learn more about what is an ECS we try to give some clarification on [this section](ecs.md).
